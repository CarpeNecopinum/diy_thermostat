# DIY Thermostat

Create custom thermostat entities for your Home Assistant.

## What does this do? / Why do I want it?

Building your own custom thermostat via Home Assistant automations works well and is nice and flexible, but using helpers for the target temperature and activation, you lose the nice `climate` GUI that Home Assistant offers.

This integration lets you create `climate` entities that do nothing on their own, but leave room for your creativity to add your own behavior via automations.
